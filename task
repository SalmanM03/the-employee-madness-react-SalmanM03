modify the employee update page as following :
make a new number field to add Years of experience for the employee  - when the level Junior is selected the users can't specify 
this (the input field is not visible) and the default value 0 should be used

Create a new frontend route in the app that displays employee records [name ,level, years of experience] by Years of experience inside the url, 
e.g. when user enters "../years-of-experience/8" user will see only employees with greater or equal then that experience - the data should be fetched from the backend

please implement sorting ascending and descending (like a toggle) for "name" in this page as well either from the frontend or backend

Invalid routes like .../years-of-experience/-1 or .../years-of-experience/dogs should result in users seeing a 404 or error page: also the backend should return a 404 in this case

Display Years of experience on the employees List page as a new "column"
